## About Me
Hey, I'm Hunter. I'm 21 years old. I'm pursuing a bachelors in Computer
Science at Utah State University. Development and automation are my passions.
I like to write code that makes it easier for me to write code, as evidenced
by some of my projects. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably writing a
blog post, working on plotting out some fiction, or playing games with my
friends.

<details>
<summary>Some other random facts about me.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>I started writing code seriously when I was about 15, with the
            goal of writing Minecraft mods (I still haven't written any).</li>
        <li>I draw occasionally, but I'm still learning how to do that.</li>
        <li>I listen to Chillstep and Drum and Bass while I code.</li>
    </ul>

### [ShatteredCore](https://github.com/ShatteredSuite/ShatteredCore)
[![ShatteredCore](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=ShatteredSuite&repo=ShatteredCore)](https://github.com/ShatteredSuite/ShatteredCore)

![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Kotlin-F18E33?style=for-the-badge&logo=kotlin&logoColor=ffffff) ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-b07219?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=ffffff) ![Gradle](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Gradle-e69f56?style=for-the-badge&logo=gradle&logoColor=ffffff)

ShatteredCore is a Spigot plugin and library that abstracts some of my
frustrations with the API away. It also allows me to use Kotlin, one of my
favorite languages, in my projects. Some of the neat things that it does are:
* Abstracts Commands into a nicer tree-based format that automatically
generates tab completions and validates arguments.
* Enforces localization by default. 
* Provides utilities for reading configuration files, sending messages, and converting
 strings into other things.
* Provides interfaces for common CRUD operations, and ways to hook those
 operations into external sources.

### [ZombieAggies.me](https://zaggies.herokuapp.com)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=fff) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PostgreSQL-336791?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=ffffff) ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Heroku-430098?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=ffffff) ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sass-CC6699?style=for-the-badge&logo=sass&logoColor=ffffff)

ZombieAggies is a website that I wrote for the Humans vs Zombies club at Utah
State University. I built this from the ground up, using JavaScript and the
following libraries:
* [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) for the server and routing.
* [knex](https://github.com/knex/knex) for database connections and migrations.
* [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) for templating.
* [sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) for styling.

It automatically deploys itself on commit to Heroku, and to a staging
environment based on branches. It has the following features:
* A tag tracking system (of course!) 
* A user permissions system where admins can grant different permissions to individuals. 
* An asset tracking system that we used to keep track of checked-out bandannas.
* An email verification system. 
* An event system. 
* A content management system used to tell a story over the course of a game. 
* A location ownership system that tallies points based on
the number of minues a point is controlled.
